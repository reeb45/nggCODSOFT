# Number Guessing Game CODSOFT



How the Game Works:

Welcome Message: Upon starting the game, the player is greeted with a friendly welcome message and instructions on how to play.

Random Number Generation: A random number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100) is generated using C++'s standard library random functions.

User Input: The player is prompted to enter their guess. The program ensures that the input is a valid integer within the allowed range.

Feedback Loop: After each guess, the player receives feedback on whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. This loop continues until the player correctly guesses the number.

Game Statistics: The game keeps track of the number of attempts the player took to guess the correct number. This information is displayed once the player successfully guesses the number.
